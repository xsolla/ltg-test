					<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
					<p><strong>General payment terms and conditions</strong></p>
					<p>
						Please, be informed that certain Software including without limitation the
						types of Software determined below may be offered to you for purchase via
						LTG Services. For the avoidance of doubt the word “purchase” or any related
						terms are referred solely to the transfer of certain license rights in the
						Software or any other digital item hereunder. LTG does not process any
						payments for such purchases by itself. &nbsp;Any and all payments, refunds
						and other transactions will be processed by the authorized LTG Partner or
						another designated third party (“merchant”) and any purchases will be
						offered by such merchants. You may be required to create an account with
						such merchant, and by doing so, you are agreeing to comply with the merchant
						terms of service and other legal agreements. You may need to provide
						additional information to verify your identity, business and tax information
						and your bank information when you register with the merchant. Payment terms
						and conditions, currency conversion, refund and any other financial terms
						will be determined in the applicable agreement between you and the merchant.
						Please, carefully read any legal information related to any transactions
						between you and such merchant before accepting the offer and/or making any
						purchase. LTG does not control merchant Services, and is not liable for the
						above-mentioned and any other third-party services, for any transaction you
						may enter into with them or for what they do. All related claims, refund and
						other requests are to be filed to the merchant directly.
					</p>
					<p>Software types:</p>
					<p>
						<u>Pre-orders</u>. A pre-order is a purchase of a Software which will be
						delivered at a later time, as the Software is still in the process of being
						developed. The pre-order stage is defined by the lack of access to playable
						content. As soon as the playable/usable content is provided, the Software is
						redefined as "Access to the Software".
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Subscriptions</u>. A subscription is a Software received on a recurring
						basis (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.). As long as the subscription is
						paid for, the product is available to the Customer. The Customer can manage
						the subscription in order to cancel or activate it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Access to the Software</u>. An access to the Software is a purchase of
						the Software where access is granted upon payment. The access can be granted
						via different means such as an activation key, a link to the launcher in the
						game account, an automatic activation of the account, etc. Different types
						of access can be sold. As a rule, an access is indefinite and does not
						expire. However, the Software may offer other in-game purchases such as
						currency, items, subscriptions, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>In-Game Currency and In-Game Items</u>. The Software may enable Customers
						to (i) use a fictional virtual currency as a medium of exchange exclusively
						within the Software ("in-game currency") and (ii) gain access to (and
						certain limited rights to use) virtual goods within the Software ("in-game
						goods"). In-game currency and in-game items (together "Virtual Items") are
						pieces of a software code processed on an electronic computing machine as
						in-game objects that the Customer acquires while performing certain actions
						within the Software or for a fee. Virtual Items can exclusively be used
						within the Software; they shall be deemed an integral part of the Software
						and shall be subject to the license granted to the Customer herein. Virtual
						Items have no real value and cannot be exchanged for non-game ("real")
						currency or non-game ("real") property. Any in-game currency balance shown
						in your Account does not entitle you to its exchange value in US Dollars or
						any other real currency, unless stated otherwise. Any trading of Virtual
						Items that you undertake within the Software or on an independent Virtual
						Currency exchange is at your sole option, discretion and risk. Your purchase
						of Virtual Items is final and not refundable if otherwise is not stipulated
						in the applicable merchant’s refund policy.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Premium Account</u>. A premium account is a one-time or recurring
						purchase of certain in-game features. A premium account may include but is
						not limited to special items, in-game currency, special avatars, boosters,
						access to restricted features, etc. Usually several types of products are
						included in one purchase.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>NFT Content</u>. You also may be offered to purchase certain NFT Content
						subject to <a href="https://xsolla.com/nft-terms">separate</a
						><strong>&nbsp;</strong>NFT Terms, which will deemed as part of these Terms
						to the extent that it does not conflict with it.
					</p>
					<p><br /><strong>(b) Pricing</strong></p>
					<p>
						The purchase price will include the price of the Software plus any
						applicable taxes in effect at the time of purchase and based on the country
						data you provide on the download page. Please, be aware that the final cost

						>
					</p>
					<p>
						TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LTG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
						ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR
						DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUES, LOST PROFITS, LOST
						DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (HOWEVER SUCH
						LOSSES ARE QUALIFIED), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS
						OF SERVICE OR THE SERVICES ITSELF, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
						OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT LTG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
						POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, LTG IS NOT
						OBLIGED TO REIMBURSE ANY DAMAGES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE
						REMEDY (AND LTG EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH LTG IS TO STOP
						USING THE SERVICES AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.
					</p>
					<p>
						NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICES SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY
						CONSUMER OR EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT ANY LIABILITY RESULTING FROM GROSS
						NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF LTG OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
						ARISING FROM ANY NEGLIGENCE OR FRAUD OF LTG.
					</p>
					<p>
						You agree to indemnify, defend and hold LTG (and our officers, directors,
						agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) harmless from any claim,
						demand, damages or other losses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
						asserted by any third-party resulting from or arising out of your use of the
						Service, or any breach by you of these Terms of Service and the Privacy
						Policy, however the foregoing does not apply if the infringement of rights
						is not attributable to your intentional or negligent behavior.
					</p>
					<p>
						You agree that the aggregate liability of LTG to you for any and all claims
						arising out of or relating to the use of, access to, or any inability to use
						or access the Services is limited to $150. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions

						incidental damages. Accordingly, the above limitation may not apply to you.

					<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
					<p><strong>1</strong><strong>4. Applicable Law, Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
					<p><strong>(a)</strong> <strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
					<p>
						These Terms of Services and any part of the Complete Terms and their
						interpretation, as well as any disputes that arise hereunder, shall be
						governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, USA,
						excluding its conflicts-of-law rules and without giving effect to any
						principles that may provide for the application of the law of another
						jurisdiction. The U. N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
						of Goods is hereby expressly disclaimed.
					</p>
					<p>
						You expressly agree that for claims and disputes not subject to the
						arbitration agreement below, exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action
						arising out of or relating to these Terms of Services and any part of the
						Complete Terms shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Los
						Angeles, California, before a single arbitrator. You and LTG agree to submit
						to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration,
						to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or
						enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitration shall
						be resolved by arbitration by one arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) in accordance
						with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
						Arbitration Association, Applicable Law and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
						Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer
						Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website at
						<a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, and the provisions of these
						Terms. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on
						the other. The place of arbitration shall be Los Angeles, California, USA.
						The cost of any arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties, but the
						Arbitrator shall be authorized to enter, as part of the award to a party, an
						amount equal to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs related to the
						arbitration, and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
						Arbitrator may award equitable relief. The Arbitrator’s decision(s) shall be
						final and conclusively binding on the Parties, and the judgment upon such
						award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration
						may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or
						online. The Arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a
						statement of reasons if requested by either party. The Arbitrator must
						follow the Applicable Law, and any award may be challenged if the Arbitrator
						fails to do so. YOU AND LTG AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
						THE OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
						CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The
						Arbitrator shall not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims
						and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding.
						The Arbitrator may only award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of
						the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
						provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific
						subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement
						to arbitrate shall be null and void.
					</p>
					<p><strong>(b) Limitation of Time to File Claims</strong></p>
					<p>
						Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to the
						Complete Terms must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of
						action accrues; otherwise such cause of action or claim is permanently
						barred.
					</p>
					<p><strong>(c) Disputes</strong></p>
					<p>
						<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Most concerns can be resolved by use of our LTG Help
						Center
						<a href="mailto:support@longtalegames.com">support@longtalegames.com</a>
						or with your personal manager designated by LTG. If we are unable to resolve
						your concerns, and a dispute remains between you and LTG, this section
						explains how we agree to resolve it.
					</p>
					<p>
						A party that intends to seek arbitration must first send written notice to
						the other party of its intent to arbitrate (<strong>«Notice»</strong>). The
						Notice to LTG should be sent by any of the following means: (i) via
						electronic mail to support@longtalegames.com; or (ii) by sending the Notice
						by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Long Tale Games LLC, at the
						address: 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808, United States. The
						Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and
						(2) set forth the specific relief sought. If we do not reach an agreement to
						resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you
						or LTG may commence an arbitration proceeding.
					</p>
					<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
					<p><strong>1</strong><strong>5. Severability</strong></p>
					<p>
						if any part of the Complete Terms is not enforceable, the rest of the
						Complete Terms still applies and is binding and any unenforceable term will
						be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
					</p>
					<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

					<p>
						The failure of LTG to require or enforce strict performance by you of any
						provision of these Terms of Service or any part of the Complete Terms or

						or right in that or any other instance.
					</p>
					<p>
						The express waiver by LTG of any provision, condition, or requirement of

					<p>
						You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these
						Terms of Services or any part of the Complete Terms are of a unique and
						irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm LTG and which
						cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that in the event of any
						breach or anticipatory breach by you LTG shall be entitled to injunctive or
						other equitable relief including but without limitation specific performance
						(without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages)
						in addition to all other remedies available to the Disclosing Party at law
						or in equity, including but not limited to general, indirect and
						consequential damages, including lost profit, indemnification for every
						loss, cost, damage or expense, and other remedies which may be available.
						&nbsp;The Parties agree that the indemnification of the damages, lost
						profit, costs shall be made in a full amount. You irrevocably waive all
						rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or
						restrain the operation of the Services, exploitation of any advertising or

						Service and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages,
						limited by Section 7 (if any).

						causes outside the reasonable control of LTG, including without limitation
						any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or caused
						beyond LTG’s control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes,
						acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or
						shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
					</p>
					<p><strong>(h) Partnership</strong></p>
					<p>

						venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and LTG
						as a result of this Agreement.
