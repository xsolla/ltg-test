					CAREFULLY.&nbsp; BY PARTICIPATING IN THE CAMPAIGN, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE

				</p>
				<h3>1. Campaign General Terms</h3>
				<p>
					1.1. Participation in the Campaign is offered collectively by Long Tale Games,
					LLC and Xsolla (USA), Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”). The Campaign is available to
					individuals for their personal engagement use solely.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					1.2. By participating in the Campaign, you (“player(s)”, “your”, “yours”)
					confirm that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms and
					Conditions, Xsolla Account Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions which
					may apply to the Campaign and your participation in it (collectively referred to
					as “Governing Terms”). If you do not agree to the Governing Terms you cannot

				<h3>2. Campaign Overview</h3>
				<p>
					2.1. The Campaign is designed to reward and thank the players of the video game
					“Life is Feudal: MMO” (hereinafter referred to as the “Game”, “Project”).
				</p>
				<p>
					2.2. In order to enroll in the Campaign, you shall have an active Xsolla
					Account. If you ever made purchases in the Game prior to its official shutdown,
					we will credit so-called “LiF Сoins” (also hereinafter referred to as “bonuses”)
					to your balance at Xsolla Account in an amount determined at our sole
					discretion. For the purposes of these Terms,&nbsp; “bonuses” shall refer to the

					be used solely by you and cannot be transferred to or shared with others. Please
					be informed that if the amount of accrued bonuses is equal to or greater than
					the total cost of the subscription, then bonuses may be used to purchase the
					subscription without the need for other payment methods. If the amount of
					bonuses is less than the total cost of the subscription, you will need to use
					another payment method to cover the difference between the subscription cost and
					the amount of bonuses at your balance that you would like to redeem.&nbsp;
					Bonuses have no cash value, are non-transferable, and cannot be exchanged or
					returned for a monetary refund. More information about the bonuses can be found
