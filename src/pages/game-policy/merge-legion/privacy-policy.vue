							Licensor&rsquo;s sole discretion. As a condition to the use of
							additional services, End User acknowledges and agrees that:</span

					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							><br />A. No one under the age of 18 is permitted to purchase Digital

							>will<span>
								be processed by a third party (&ldquo;Merchant of Record&rdquo;,
								&ldquo;MoR&rdquo;). You may be required to create an account with
								such MoR, and by doing so, you are agreeing to comply with the
								MoR</span

							><br />F. The list and cost of additional services, and the methods and
							conditions of purchasing the Digital Values will be published by

						><span
							>the appropriate MoR<span
								>. The Licensor does not make any money compensations to End User
								that performed funds transfer operations to purchase the Digital
								Values using the payment systems, if such payments were to failed
								and as the result the money was not received by Licensor if
								otherwise is not provided in the applicable Refund Policy.
								Notwithstanding the foregoing, the End User is obliged to keep

							correctness of their personal data registered on his/her Game
							account.</span

							><br />H. If Licensor has reason to think that the End User performs
							illegal activities or fraud related to payments of additional services
							in the Game, Licensor of the approp</span
						><span
							>riate MoR<span>
								has the right to send relevant information to law enforcement bodies
								to investigate these facts.</span
							></span
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							><br />I. If Licensor has reason to believe or suspects that the End
							User is exploiting any defects in the Game or is maliciously using any
							third party software to increase his/her amount of Digital Values, or if

							><br />K. End User agrees to take appropriate measures to ensure the

						<span><br />15. GOVERNING LAW</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							><br />A. Informal Negotiations: To expedite resolution and control the
							cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this EULA
							(&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;), you and Licensor agree to first attempt to
							negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
							informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any
							arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiation commence upon
							written notice from one person to the other. Licensor will send its
							notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address
							you have provided to us. You will send your notice to Licensor&rsquo;s
							address at </span
						><span>support@longtalegames.com</span
						><span
							>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Licensor agree that the
							following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
							informal negotiations: (1) any Disputes concerning the validity of any
							of Licensor&rsquo;s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute
							related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
							privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.<br /><br />B.
							Governing Law and Dispute Resolution: This EULA will be governed by and
							construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA,
							excluding its conflicts-of-law rules and without giving effect to any
							principles that may provide for the application of the law of another
							jurisdiction. This EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations
							Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the
							application of which is expressly excluded. You expressly agree that for
							claims and disputes not subject to the arbitration agreement below,
							exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or
							relating to this EULA shall be determined by final and binding
							arbitration in Los Angeles, California, before a single arbitrator. You
							and Licensor agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court,
							in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration,
							or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by
							the arbitrator. The arbitration shall be resolved by arbitration by one
							arbitrator (&ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;) in accordance with the
							then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
							Association, Applicable Law and, where appropriate, the AAA&rsquo;s
							Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&ldquo;AAA
							Consumer Rules&rdquo;), both of which are available at the AAA website
							at&nbsp;</span
						><a href="https://www.adr.org/"><span>www.adr.org</span></a
						><span
							>, and the provisions of these Terms. Any election to arbitrate by one
							party shall be final and binding on the other. The place of arbitration
							shall be Los Angeles, California, USA. The cost of any arbitration shall
							be shared equally by the parties, but the Arbitrator shall be authorized
							to enter, as part of the award to a party, an amount equal to reasonable
							attorneys&rsquo; fees and other costs related to the arbitration, and,
							where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The Arbitrator may
							award equitable relief. The Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision(s) shall be
							final and conclusively binding on the Parties, and the judgment upon
							such award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
							arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
							documents, by phone or online. The Arbitrator shall make a decision in
							writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either
							party. The Arbitrator must follow the Applicable Law, and any award may
							be challenged if the Arbitrator fails to do so.&nbsp;YOU AND LICENSOR
							AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS
							INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
							PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp;The Arbitrator shall
							not consolidate another person&rsquo;s claims with your claims and shall
							not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The
							Arbitrator may only award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of
							the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
							provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. If this
							specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
							this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.</span

					</p>

					<p>
						<span
							><br />16. WAIVER &amp; SEVERABILITY<br /><br />A failure on the part of
							Licensor to act with respect to a breach by you or others of this EULA
							does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar
							breaches. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
							provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of
							this EULA shall continue in full force and effect.</span

					<p>
						<span
							>We will try to promptly process your request regarding data privacy in
							the following manner:</span
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							>13.1. In order to proceed with your request we will ask to verify your
							identity by a proof of your previous payment to us or from your payment
							system account or by email, which is linked to your previous payment in
							our system, by providing an ID or by other means within the applicable
							law. If we receive the request from your authorized agent, we may ask
							such an authorized agent to verify the authenticity and validity of the
							request as it is provided by the applicable law:</span

					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							>- To provide signed permission confirming the authority of the
							agent;</span
						>
					</p>
					<p>

							LTG.</span

					<p>
						<span
							>13.5. If your response is considerably complex, or we have received a
							number of various requests from you at once, the above stated timeframe
							of answering to your request may be extended up to 2 months. We will
							directly notify you about such an extension before the due date of the
							response in the same manner as the request did.<br />Please note the
							response might be considered as a complex one upon the specific
							circumstances of that certain response. For example, if data is already
							electronically archived, or we need to clarify potential issues around
							disclosing information about a child to a legal guardian, or obtain
							specialist legal advice.</span
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span
							>13.6. In exceptional cases, we may charge you a reasonable fee for the
