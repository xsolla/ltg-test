					</p>
					<p>
						I. If Licensor has reason to believe or suspects that the End User is exploiting any defects in the Game or is maliciously using any third-party software to increase his/her amount of Digital Values, or if Licensor has reason to believe that such increase of Digital Values originates from a flaw in the system, Licensor or the appropriate MoR has the right to immediately delete that End User’s account and the entire account balance shall be deemed forfeited.
					</p>
					<p>
						J.

						B. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution: This EULA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules and without giving effect to any principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. This EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. You expressly agree that for claims and disputes not subject to the arbitration agreement below, exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this EULA shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California, before a single arbitrator. You and Licensor agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitration shall be resolved by arbitration by one arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, Applicable Law and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website at www.adr.org, and the provisions of these Terms. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The place of arbitration shall be Los Angeles, California, USA. The cost of any arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties, but the Arbitrator shall be authorized to enter, as part of the award to a party, an amount equal to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs related to the arbitration, and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The Arbitrator may award equitable relief. The Arbitrator’s decision(s) shall be final and conclusively binding on the Parties, and the judgment upon such award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The Arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The Arbitrator must follow the Applicable Law, and any award may be challenged if the Arbitrator fails to do so. YOU AND LICENSOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The Arbitrator shall not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The Arbitrator may only award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.

					</p>
					<p>
						A failure on the part of Licensor to act with respect to a breach by you or others of this EULA does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this EULA shall continue in full force and effect.
